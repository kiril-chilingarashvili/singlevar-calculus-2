As $n$ tends to infinity, this becomes $x = -1$. So the lower limit of the integral is $-1$. When $i=n$, then $x=-1+\\frac{2n}{n} = 1$. Therefore the upper limit of the definite integral is $1$. This confirms what we discovered earlier, the length of the integral we are integrating over is $-1 -(-1) = 2$.\n",
