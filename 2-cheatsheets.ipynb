    "## FTC1 versus MVT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Let us compare what the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and what the Mean Value Theorem say about the average rate of change of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We see that the FTC1 gives a specific value for $\\frac{\\Delta F}{\\Delta x}$, the average rate of change of $F$ over $[a, b]$, but the MVT does not, since it does not tell us where  is.\n",
    "### Therefore, the First Fundamental Theorem is much more useful than the Mean Value Theorem. Once we have FTC1 at our disposal, we do not need to use MVT anymore. Nonetheless, the Mean Value Theorem is important as the basis of calculus. We needed it to establish the fact that two antiderivatives of the same function can only differ by a constant. We will need this fact again in order to finally prove FTC1 along with FTC2 in the next section."
